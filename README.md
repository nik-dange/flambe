# food-delivery-microservices

This is an event-driven, microservices based implementation of a food delivery service! 

Some of the technologies I'm using are:

- RabbitMQ, for asynchronous message queue functionality and pub/sub logic
- Express.js, for a web server

And eventually,

- Perhaps another service written in Go since Go is cool
- Docker, to containerize each microservice
- Kubernetes, to help deploy and maintain the incredible scale my new project will demand :)
